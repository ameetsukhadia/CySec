step 1, i found out my local IP address using ifconfig in linux terminal which is 10.0.2.15
step 2, and netmask is 255.255.255.0 
step 3, then i use nmap tool for scanning the open ports and services (e.g. 10.0.2.0/24)
these are the ip addr 10.0.2.2, 10.0.2.3, 10.0.2.4, 10.0.2.15
scan report for 10.0.2.2 open ports are 135/tcp with service of msrpc, 445/tcp with service of microsoft-ds, 5357/tcp with service of wsdapi 
scan report for 10.0.2.3 open ports are 135/tcp with service of msrpc, 445/tcp with service of microsoft-ds, 5357/tcp with service of wsdapi
scan report for 10.0.2.4 open ports are 135/tcp with service of msrpc, 445/tcp with service of microsoft-ds, 5357/tcp with service of wsdapi
scan report for 10.0.2.15 which machine local addr, nmap scaned 1000 ports by default and all 1000 are in ignored state

discription of service and related vulnerablities
msrpc (microsoft remote procedure call) that use port 135 by default, it can use ip addr range between 1024-65535 in older system. msrpc service enables a program on one computer to execute 
on another computer. vulnerablities are security flaws in windows system. these vulnerablity can be used to execute arbitrary code on affected system.

microsoft-ds (microsoft directory service) it refers to the directory service such as SMB (server message block) protocol running on port 445 by default. it enables the service like files sharing
, printer sharing and other network service. Vulnerability or security flaws in SMB could allow remote execution.

wsdapi (web services on devices API) supports the implementation of client-controlled devices and services, and device hosts conforming to the Devices Profile for Web Services (DPWS).
WSD allows a client to discover and access a remote device and its associated services across a network. It supports device discovery, description, control, and eventing. vulnerabilty in  wsdapi
can allow attacker to remote code execution using special crafted packets.
